We have released the stringio gem version 3.0.1.1 and 3.0.1.2 that have a security fix for a buffer overread vulnerability.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-27280](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27280).

## Details

An issue was discovered in StringIO 3.0.1, as distributed in Ruby 3.0.x through 3.0.6 and 3.1.x through 3.1.4.

The ungetbyte and ungetc methods on a StringIO can read past the end of a string, and a subsequent call to StringIO.gets may return the memory value.

This vulnerability is not affected by Ruby 3.2.x and later.

## Recommended action

We recommend to update the stringio gem to version 3.0.1.2 or later. In order to ensure compatibility with bundled version in older Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:

* For Ruby 3.0 users: Update to `stringio` 3.0.1.1

StringIO-3.0.1.2 contained bugfix for [[Bug #19389]][https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/1d24a931c458c93463da1d5885f33edef3677cc2]. This fix has been backported to Ruby 3.1.4. But we didn't change stringio version from 3.0.1. Therefore, we released 3.0.1.2 to include the vulnerability fix.

You can use `gem update stringio` to update it. If you are using bundler, please add `gem "stringio", ">= 3.0.1.2"` to your `Gemfile`.

## Affected versions

* Ruby 3.0.6 or lower
* Ruby 3.1.4 or lower
* StringIO gem 3.0.1 or lower
